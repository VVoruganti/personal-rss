# Personal RSS Feed
This project is an attempt to create a custom rss feed that will send me an email each day in the morning with all of the relevant
information that I need to get ready. It also being used as an excuse to learn web scraping and any other technologies
that may become necessary for this to work. 

The scope of this project could probably be accomplished with some other already packaged app, but I thought this would be
fun.
