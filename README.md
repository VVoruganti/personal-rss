# Personal RSS Feed

This project is an attempt to create a custom rss feed that will send me an email
each day in the morning with all of the relevant information that I need to get
ready. It also being used as an excuse to learn web scraping and any other technologies
that may become necessary for this to work.

The scope of this project could probably be accomplished with some other already
packaged app, but I thought this would be fun.
